# Breast-Cancer-Detection-with-Machine-Learning-and-Image-Video-Processing-Algorithms-Python
Abstractâ€” This paper presents a machine learning (ML) method for detection and visual analysis of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) locations in whole slide images (WSI) of breast cancer. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence approach that learns from the experience consisting of computational methods and statistics to learn information directly from the dataset for modeling the relationships in data. It is a similar approach to how the human brain works by interpreting features such as representative layers.
